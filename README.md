# Task 3 – Multi-Cloud Architecture (AWS + GCP)

## 🌐 Architecture Overview
This project demonstrates a simple multi-cloud setup where:
- **Frontend** is hosted on AWS S3
- **Backend** (API) is powered by Google Cloud Function

---

## 🔗 Public URLs
- **AWS S3 Website**: [Multi-Cloud Frontend](https://multi-cloud-frontend-mitesh.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/index.html)
- **GCP Cloud Function**: [GCP API](https://asia-south1-root-dispatch-458612-b2.cloudfunctions.net/hello_world) (called via JS)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- AWS S3 (Static Website)
- Google Cloud Function (Python / Node.js)
- HTTPS API Call via `fetch()`
- CORS enabled in Cloud Function

---

## 📸 Screenshots
- ✅ S3 Bucket Configuration
- ✅ Cloud Function Console
- ✅ Browser Output (API response)
- ✅ Architecture Diagram (optional)

---

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
- Understood how to link two cloud providers
- Learned basics of serverless functions
- Managed public access securely using IAM and policies
- Used Free Tier resources from both platforms

---

## 🛡️ Cost Management
- S3 Storage < 5GB (Free Tier)
- Cloud Function < 2M calls/month (Free Tier)
- Function and bucket will be deleted after evaluation
